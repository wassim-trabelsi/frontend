### Context

I always have a hard time deciding which movie to watch in the evening. 

### Todo

- a list of popular movies to pick from, with some info about them, --> MVP OK
- among those movies, a way to select those available in French --> MVP OK
- some other people reviews, ideally one positive and one negative.

### Your mission

Build a web utility for Richard. This exercise is open-ended, you have room to be creative.
