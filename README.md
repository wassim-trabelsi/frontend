### Context

Richard always has a hard time deciding which movie to watch in the evening. He told us he wants:
- a list of popular movies to pick from, with some info about them,
- among those movies, a way to select those available in French,
- some other people reviews, ideally one positive and one negative.

### Your mission

Build a web utility for Richard. This exercise is open-ended, you have room to be creative.

You may use APIs provided by [themoviedb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies), but you are free to do otherwise.

Note the [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) can help you build nice UIs more easily!
